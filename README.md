## Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify and retain at-risk customers. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to predict churn based on customer features. 

The application allows users to:
1. Input customer details and predict churn probability.
2. Gain insights into the model's predictions.
3. Use the deployed web application to interact with the model.
