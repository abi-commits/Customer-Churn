# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project uses a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting customer churn. The model is built using deep learning techniques and is designed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various customer features. The goal is to provide insights for businesses to retain valuable customers.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how deep learning models, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), can be used to predict customer churn. Customer churn prediction can help businesses proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing them to take appropriate actions to retain them.

### Features:

- Preprocessing and cleaning of customer data.
- Model architecture with an ANN for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Visualization of results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a fictional customer data with features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and other behavior metrics. The dataset may include columns like:

- Age
- Tenure
- Product usage
- Customer satisfaction
- Subscription type
- Churn (target variable)

You can find the dataset (or a similar one) from [source URL or dataset provider].
